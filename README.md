## [About the Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification)

> <pr>***Context***<br>This is image data of Natural Scenes around the world.</p><p>***Content***<br>This Data contains around 25k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories.<br>{'buildings' -> 0,<br>'forest' -> 1,<br>'glacier' -> 2,<br>'mountain' -> 3,<br>'sea' -> 4,<br>'street' -> 5 }<br><br>The Train, Test and Prediction data is separated in each zip files. There are around 14k images in Train, 3k in Test and 7k in Prediction.
This data was initially published on [https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com) by Intel to host a Image classification Challenge.
